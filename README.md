# Analyze-AB-Test_Results
This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.


# Overview:

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientist. This project is to work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

During data analysis, the steps involved were data cleaning, page assignment, hypothesis testing, standard statistic tests, and multiple regression modelling. 


# Statistical Analysis:

Sampling distribution and p-value calculations, z-score test, multiple linear regression modelling, and logistic regression.
